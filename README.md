### Quickstart 👏

I really, **really** enjoy 🛠 building stuff - regardless of whether it's created using a 💻, 🎸, 🍳, 🎮...

My toolkit primarily consists primarily of [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) and [**Go**](https://go.dev/). Because my professional work leans more heavily on Python, my tinkering and OSS projects tend to be in Go.
